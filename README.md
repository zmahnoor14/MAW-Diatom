# MAW-Diatom

Metabolome Annotation Workflow (MAW) was used to perform metaboli profiling of Skeletonema marinoi using the spectral data from Liquid Chromtohtaphy Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LCMS2). The data of the RAW and mzML files is submitted to MetaboLights with the accession number: [MTBLS2892](www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS2892) 



# Suspect List
The suspect list curation was performed using the suspectlits_curation.py. The comments in the script provide detail on all steps involved in the curation process and can be applicable to other suspect lists or any list with SMILES.
